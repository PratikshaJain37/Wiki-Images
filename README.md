# README - wiki_images.py

## Description
A python script to display information about a list of users contributions to Wikimedia Commons. A .csv is generated with all the wikipedia pages where the images are used.

## Tech Stack Used
The script is mainly Python3.7 compliant.
The major libraries used are *beautifulsoup, threading, configparser, requests, and pandas*.

## Installation
For running the script (inside a virtual environment):
(With reference from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
1. Setting up the virtual environment in the folder  
`python3 -m venv images_venv`  
2. Activating the virtual environment   
In Windows:  
`images_venv/Scripts/activate.bat`  
In Linux/Unix:  
`source ./venv/bin/activate`  
(If you use the csh or fish shells, the alternate is activate.csh and activate.fish)  
3. Installing the required libraries  
`pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas getopt sys tqdm`  
4. Running the script  
`python3 wiki_images.py`  

A new csv file, with the name 'Wiki_Images.csv' will appear, which has the required output.
