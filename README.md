# README - wiki_images.py

## Description
A python script to display information about a user's contributions to Wikimedia Commons. A .csv is generated with all the wikipedia pages where the images are used.

## Requirements
The script is mainly Python3.7 compliant.
The libraries needed are:
1. requests 2.24.0
(https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
2. beautifulsoup4 4.9.3
(https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
3. pandas 1.1.3
(https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
4. tqdm 4.54.0
(https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)
5. time 
GNU time 1.7

## Installation
For running the script (inside a virtual environment):
(With reference from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
1. Setting up the virtual environment in the folder
$ python3 -m venv images_venv
2. Activating the virtual environment 
In Windows:
$ images_venv/Scripts/activate.bat
In Linux/Unix:
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
(If you use the csh or fish shells, the alternate is activate.csh and activate.fish)
3. Installing the required libraries
    $ pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas getopt sys tqdm
4. Running the script
    $ python3 wiki_images.py

A new csv file, with the name 'Wiki_Images.csv' will appear, which has the required output.
